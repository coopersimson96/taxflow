### Spacing System
- **Component Gap**: space-y-12 (48px between major sections)
- **Card Padding**: p-10 or p-12 (40-48px internal padding)
- **Element Gap**: space-y-6 (24px between related elements)
- **Tight Spacing**: space-y-3 (12px for compact groups)

### Card Design (Chosenly Style)
- **Border Radius**: rounded-3xl (24px) - very soft, organic feel
- **Shadow**: Minimal or no shadow, rely on borders instead
- **Hover State**: Subtle scale (hover:scale-[1.01]) and border color change
- **Border**: Thick borders (border-2 or border-3) in dark (#071D19 at 15%)
- **Background**: Pure white (#FFFFFF) on cream background

### Button Styles (Chosenly Approach)
- **Primary**: Dark background (#071D19), white text, lime accent on hover
- **Secondary**: White bg, dark border-2, dark text, hover:bg-lime-100
- **Accent**: Lime green (#D3FFBA) background, dark text, hover:brightness-110
- **Sizes**: Very generous padding (px-8 py-4 for regular, px-10 py-5 for large)
- **Border Radius**: rounded-full (pill-shaped)
- **Typography**: font-semibold, slightly larger text

### Visual Effects
- **No Gradients**: Flat, bold colors - no gradients
- **Bold Borders**: Use thick borders (2-3px) for definition
- **Lime Accents**: Strategic use of lime green for CTAs and highlights
- **High Contrast**: Strong contrast between dark text and light backgrounds
- **Geometric Shapes**: Clean, bold geometric elements

### Database Optimization
- Add index on payout_date column
- Add index on organization_id + payout_date for faster queries
- Consider materialized view for monthly summaries if queries are slow

### Caching
- Cache payout calculations for 5 minutes (don't recalculate every render)
- Use SWR or React Query for data fetching with stale-while-revalidate
- Cache expanded order details per payout

### Rendering Optimization
- Memoize expensive calculations with useMemo
- Memoize callback functions with useCallback
- Use React.memo for components that don't need frequent re-renders
- Virtualize order list if more than 50 orders

### Bundle Size
- Check bundle size with next/bundle-analyzer
- Ensure icons are tree-shaken (only import used icons from lucide-react)
- Remove any unused dependencies

### Metrics to Monitor
- Time to first contentful paint (target: <1.5s)
- Time to interactive (target: <2.5s)
- Dashboard data fetch time (target: <500ms)
- Payout expansion time (target: <300ms)

**Tools**: Use Lighthouse and Chrome DevTools Performance tab to measure improvements.

**What this accomplishes:**
- Fast, responsive dashboard
- Efficient data fetching
- Smooth animations even with many orders
- Good user experience even on slower connections

## Design Philosophy Summary

The new dashboard follows these principles:

1. **Action-Oriented**: Every element guides user toward setting tax aside
2. **Transparency**: Users can drill into details when needed
3. **Clean & Modern**: White cards, subtle shadows, generous spacing
4. **Mobile-First**: Fully functional on phones where business owners check it
5. **Trustworthy**: Financial app aesthetic with clear, accurate information
6. **No Clutter**: Removed duplicate metrics and unnecessary navigation

The old dashboard tried to show everything. The new one shows what matters: today's action, monthly progress, and historical context - with details available on demand.
