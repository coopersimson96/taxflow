# Force Complete Rebuild to Clear Cache

The issue is likely cached Prisma Client or build artifacts. Here's what to do:

## In Vercel Dashboard:

1. **Clear Build Cache**:
   - Go to your Vercel project settings
   - Find "Build & Output Settings" 
   - Look for an option to clear build cache OR
   - In the deployments tab, click "..." → "Clear Cache and Deploy"

2. **Double-Check Environment Variable**:
   - Go to Settings → Environment Variables
   - Make sure DATABASE_URL shows: `postgresql://postgres:Supabasetaxflow45123@db.zpxltmcmtfqrgystdvxu.supabase.co:5432/postgres`
   - If there are multiple DATABASE_URL entries, delete the wrong ones

3. **Force Complete Rebuild**:
   - Make a small change to trigger new deployment (like add a comment to any file)
   - Or manually redeploy from deployments tab

The error showing `aws-0-ca-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com` means either:
- Old cached build artifacts are being used
- Wrong environment variable is still active
- Multiple DATABASE_URL variables exist

This commit forces a fresh Prisma Client to avoid cached connections.
